### Paper Mario: TTYD Infinite Pit Mod (v2.01 r51) by Jdaster64

### Credits
*   **PistonMiner** - For the initial REL framework and related tools, and 
    ttydasm, which was immensely useful as reference for vanilla TTYD event 
    scripts; both can be found on the 
    [ttyd-tools repository](https://github.com/PistonMiner/ttyd-tools).
*   **Zephiles** - For the 
    [TTYD practice codes](https://github.com/Zephiles/TTYD-Practice-Codes) 
    (both for ease of testing, and for implementation reference), 
    contributions towards the REL framework (in particular, methods for 
    loading the REL), and creating the original Pit Randomizer, 
    which was the primary inspiration for this mod.
*   Both of the above, **Jasper**, **SolidifiedGaming** and other folks who've 
    helped with TTYD documentation.
*   **Kappy** and **Fatguy703** for pre-release playtesting and feedback.

### Overview
Paper Mario: TTYD Infinite Pit is a Roguelike mod of TTYD's Pit of 100 Trials 
by Jdaster64. In it, Mario is pit against an endless series of random enemy 
fights, with random item drops, chest rewards, and more!

Nearly all random elements to setups and rewards are seeded using the save
file name, so you can try to improve your time or endurance on a particular 
seed, or have multiple players race to floor 100 or compete to see who can make
it the farthest.

For a detailed overview the mod's features, see
[the PDF companion guide](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O3HeDO48nqtygA-JTM8_VO5MC4-EOBvc/view?usp=sharing),

### Setup
Before attempting to install the mod, make sure you have **an unmodified copy of 
the North American (U) version of TTYD**.
This can be either an orignal retail disc or a clean ISO
(md5 of **db9a997a617ee03bbc32336d6945ec02**).

**This mod _will not work_ on any other version of the game, and support is not 
guaranteed with any other mods.**

After verifying you have a workable copy of the game:

1.  Download the latest version of the .GCI necessary to run the mod from the
    ["Releases" page](https://github.com/jdaster64/ttyd-infinite-pit/releases).
1.  Import the .GCI onto your memory card (remove any other mods' .GCIs,
    e.g. Shufflizer, but do not remove your TTYD save file.)
1.  Use either a hacked save file or a GCI loader Gecko/AR code to bootstrap
    the mod's code when running the game.
    
See [this guide](https://bit.ly/2Qi7krl) for more details on the 
installation process.


### Known Issues
